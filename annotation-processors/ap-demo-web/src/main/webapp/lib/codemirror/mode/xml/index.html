    The indentation tries to be &lt;em&gt;somewhat &amp;quot;do what
    I mean&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;... but might not match your style.

    </script>
    <p>The XML mode supports two configuration parameters:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>htmlMode (boolean)</code></dt>
      <dd>This switches the mode to parse HTML instead of XML. This
      means attributes do not have to be quoted, and some elements
      (such as <code>br</code>) do not require a closing tag.</dd>
      <dt><code>alignCDATA (boolean)</code></dt>
      <dd>Setting this to true will force the opening tag of CDATA
      blocks to not be indented.</dd>
    </dl>
