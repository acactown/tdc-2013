// Utility function that allows modes to be combined. The mode given
// as the base argument takes care of most of the normal mode
// functionality, but a second (typically simple) mode is used, which
// can override the style of text. Both modes get to parse all of the
// text, but when both assign a non-null style to a piece of code, the
// overlay wins, unless the combine argument was true, in which case
// the styles are combined.

// overlayParser is the old, deprecated name
