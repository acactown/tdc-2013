        <p>Handles AT&amp;T assembler syntax (more specifically this handles
        the GNU Assembler (gas) syntax.)
        It takes a single optional configuration parameter:
        <code>architecture</code>, which can be one of <code>"ARM"</code>,
        <code>"ARMv6"</code> or <code>"x86"</code>.
        Including the parameter adds syntax for the registers and special
        directives for the supplied architecture.
