print(X)
print("Accessing individual elements --")
cat("Your height is ", X$height, " and your weight is ", X$weight, "\n")

# FUNCTIONS --
square <- function(x) {

}
cat("The square of 3 is ", square(3), "\n")

                 # default value of the arg is set to 5.

cat("Calling cube with 2 : ", cube(2), "\n")    # will give 2^3
cat("Calling cube        : ", cube(), "\n")     # will default to 5^3.

# LEARN ABOUT FUNCTIONS THAT RETURN MULTIPLE OBJECTS --

}
print("Showing powers of 3 --"); print(powerful(3));

# In R, the last expression in a function is, by default, what is
# returned. So you could equally just say:
powerful <- function(x) {list(x2=x*x, x3=x*x*x, x4=x*x*x*x)}
