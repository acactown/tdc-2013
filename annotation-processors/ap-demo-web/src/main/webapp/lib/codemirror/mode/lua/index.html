    <p>Loosely based on Franciszek
    Wawrzak's <a href="http://codemirror.net/1/contrib/lua">CodeMirror
    1 mode</a>. One configuration parameter is
    supported, <code>specials</code>, to which you can provide an
    array of strings to have those identifiers highlighted with
    the <code>lua-special</code> style.</p>
